  ## ***<u>About me</u>*** 📝

I am ***Bal Narendra Sapa***, an engineer who likes to solve problems related to AI and Technology. I have always been good at mathematics since childhood and developed a keen interest in computer science during my schooling years as it involves mathematics heavily. I chose a ***Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science Engineering at Rajiv Gandhi University of Knowledge Technologies (IIIT Basar)***, where I was exposed to programming, technologies, and AI. After my bachelor’s, I pursued ***Master’s degree in Data Science at the University of New Haven, Connecticut***, where I learned extensively about Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Data Science. I have worked on multiple projects related to AI and contributed to open-source repositories on GitHub (refer to [Projects](#projects-)). I have also gained industry experience by working at companies on AI-related problems across different areas (refer to [Work Experience](#work-experience-)).

### Open-Source Contribution to Langchain

### Drivable Area & Lane Segmentation

This project focuses on fine-tuning a model using a dataset generated through stable diffusion for Drivable Area and Lane segmentation. The dataset includes images and annotations for both tasks, utilizing labelme for annotation. The dataset is partitioned into Train, Test, and Validation sets, with annotations for Drivable Area and Lane Detection. The model is trained with transformations like random perspective and HSV color augmentation. Deployed on Hugging Face Spaces, it's accessible through Docker or a Python virtual environment. References include the TwinLiteNet model for segmentation. Explore the dataset on [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/bnsapa/road-detection) and deploy the model locally. 


### E-Commerce FAQ Chatbot with PEFT & LoRA

Developed by Bal Narendra Sapa and Ajay Kumar Jagu from the University of New Haven, this project introduces an E-Commerce FAQ Chatbot using Parameter Efficient Fine Tuning (PEFT) with the Falcon-7B model. We fine-tuned the base model with custom e-commerce FAQ dataset. Leveraging the LoRA Technique for Low-Rank Adaptation, the chatbot streamlines customer support, reduces operational costs, and optimizes resource allocation. The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, comprises 79 samples. The deployment includes a Streamlit application, and the code and fine-tuned model are available on Hugging Face. Check out the [Kaggle Notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/balnarendrasapa/fine-tuning-falcon-7b-with-faq-e-com-dataset) for a walkthrough.
