## ***<u>About me</u> 📝***

I am ***Bal Narendra Sapa***, an engineer who likes to solve problems related to AI and Technology. I have always been good at mathematics since childhood and developed a keen interest in computer science during my schooling years as it involves mathematics heavily. I chose a ***Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science Engineering at Rajiv Gandhi University of Knowledge Technologies (IIIT Basar)***, where I was exposed to programming, technologies, and AI. After my bachelor’s, I pursued ***Master’s degree in Data Science at the University of New Haven, Connecticut***, where I learned extensively about Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Data Science. I have worked on multiple projects related to AI and contributed to open-source repositories on GitHub (refer to [Projects](#projects)). I have also gained industry experience by working at companies on AI-related problems across different areas (refer to [Work Experience](#work-experience)).
